    "# Problem\n",
    "We would like to calibrate a GridLAB-D house model based on a data collected from a house.  The house parameters we wish to calibrate are the indoor-outdoor and air-mass conductivities $U_A$ and $U_M$, the air and mass heat capacities $C_A$ and $C_M$, and the HVAC system heating and cooling efficieicies $\\eta_H$ and $\\eta_C$.  The available data is the hourly outdoor air temperature $T_O$, indoor air temperature $T_A$, heating and cooling setpoints $T_H$ and $T_C$, and the total electric energy demand of the HVAC system."

At the end of the first run, the model calibration process is run (see [calibrate.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/calibrate.py)) and the second time, the model evaluation process is run (see [evaluate.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/evaluate.py))."
